  A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is
  a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell
  form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an
  alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower
  lid.[1][2] Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is fitted inside the
  lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a
  built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen
  display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating
  systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were
  originally developed for desktop computers.

  Laptops can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs and can be
  folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable
  for mobile use.[3] Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work
  (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web browsing,
  for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.

<p>
  There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger
  laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and
  &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and
  &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like
  smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops
  for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful
  processors or graphics hardware.[44] All of these terms have fallen out of
  favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities
  have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished
  by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized
  purpose the machine is intended for, such as a &quot;gaming laptop&quot; or a
  &quot;mobile workstation&quot; for professional use.

  The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer
  industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several
  previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s
  emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops.
  All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in
  a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.

<h3 id="rugged-laptop">Rugged laptop</h3>
<p>
  A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such
  as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments.
  Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular
  laptops,[47] and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.

  The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop
  counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use,
  The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the
  maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components,
  although that difference has increasingly narrowed.[48]
</p>
<p>
  In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable
  by the end-user, except for components that can be detached; in the past,
  batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. Some laptops feature
  socketed processors with sockets such as the Socket G2, but many laptops use
  processors that are soldered to the motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM
  and storage that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced.
  This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop
  computers, because the large &quot;tower&quot; cases used in desktop computers
  are designed so that new motherboards, hard disks, sound cards, RAM, and other
  components can be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some
  disassembly, but with the most compact laptops, there may be no upgradeable
  components at all.[49]
